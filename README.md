# Banking-record-managment-system
In This project, I focused on a record of customer’s account services in bank, so it is named “Customer Account Bank Management System”. 
Here, you can create a new account, update information of an existing account, view and manage transactions, check the details of an existing account, remove existing account and view customers’ list.
The code run with three header files which include 
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<windows.h
